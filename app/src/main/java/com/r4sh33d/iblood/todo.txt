New flow:

- Send Notification to the blood donor

- On Donors phone. Calculate the nearest blood bank (Taking in to consideration, Donor location and Seeker location and blood bank location)...

- On Donors phone, set Time and date for the appointment, send it to the blood seeker.. View distance to the chosen blood bank too.

- Schedule a reminder on the donors phone,  Alert them when it's almost time, show them the route

- On Blood seekers phone, view direction to the location.

- They still need to contact themselves


Challenges
 - Manual mapping of blood banks?

What happens if blood seeker is already in an hospital.?
why not go to blood bank directly to donate ?
Would it involve telling the blood banks ahead?
